# Numerical_Analysis_Project1
This repo contains code the results for both tasks of the project:
- In ImageMorphing/ you will see a program that can rotate and distort an input image to any degrees and different radius
- In FaceMorphing/ you will see a program that transform one face to another using TPS Transform between face-landmarks
  
Detailed descriptions and implementations can be found in each folder.
